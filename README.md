# js-audiocontext-notes

## Summary

This is a quick practice project for using AudioContext to make sounds from Javascript based on raw waveforms (sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth). The AudioContext class is used, as in the first example below, to create, start and stop a sound. I quickly made a test play button and a keyboard which shows that I was able to generate a table of note frequences based on the formula found in the second source below.
